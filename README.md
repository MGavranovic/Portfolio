# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my Personal Portfolio Website, where I'll track my coding journey by adding new projects and experiences that I gain.

As you can see, this project is not completed fully and I will be adding new features, as well as working on better design and makeing it more user friendly for people on their phone and tablets.

I've been pretty busy with my classes and exams and my full time job, but I'll do my best to keep working on this and code daily.

Hope you like it!
